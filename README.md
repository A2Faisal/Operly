# Operly | Premium Support for Founders

**Live Demo:** operly.org

Operly is a high-end, responsive agency website built for a Canada-based Virtual Assistant firm. It focuses on clean aesthetics, professional operational systems, and a seamless user experience for solo founders and growing businesses.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React 18 and Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsive Design:** Elegant mobile-first UI with a custom-built navigation system.
- **Interactive UX:** Custom scroll-reveal animations and a state-managed mobile menu.
- **Operational Logic:** A functional lead-capture form integrated with a PHP backend for secure email delivery.
- **Brand Identity:** Sophisticated typography (Playfair Display & Plus Jakarta Sans) and a minimalist "Sand & Emerald" color palette.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Single Page Application (SPA):** Optimized routing using `.htaccess` for professional cPanel deployment.
- **Clean State Management:** Utilizes React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for UI interactions.
- **CSS-in-JS Architecture:** Leverages Tailwind's utility-first approach combined with internal CSS for brand-specific components like the "Glass Card" and "Animated Status Badge."
